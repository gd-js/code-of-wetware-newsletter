## 1-humility-scales
In the normative context of working as a professional Full Stack Developer, and subsequently contractor, the modus vivendi of interaction, work ethic or overall moral composure and behavior _regarding anyone and anything involved_ should line up among all participants.

The solution here is fractalism. From the concrete coding station and setup of a developer, or entire team at hand, through the project manager(s) to the CTO or CEO: Everyone deals with the same abstract clusters of Enablers within the (global) market, the concrete business, the (multi) project (managment), the concrete product and even the single unit test, and is ultimately human.

Being intellectually honest, we must confess that we all "struggle" with the best possible setup, current cutting edge paradigm, the most frictionless workflow. This is true for all participants, whatever their job description.

Between the given tension of an objectively unstable landscape and concrete personal humanity, **all encompassing humilty** facilitates the most pragmatic approach to accomplish above in the most optimal way, solely because humility scales.
